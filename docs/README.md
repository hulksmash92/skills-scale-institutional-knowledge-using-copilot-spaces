OctoAcme runs projects through a clear lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective, with an emphasis on small, iterative deliveries. Work begins with a lightweight Project One-pager to confirm the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and an initial timeline. During planning the team breaks approved initiatives into prioritized backlog items with acceptance criteria, estimates, and a Definition of Done; dependencies and risks are captured in a Risk Register and surfaced during kickoff and weekly syncs. The project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) serves as the single source of truth for task state and flow.

Key workflows emphasize disciplined pull requests and CI gatekeeping: small PRs (target <= 400 lines) that reference the related issue and acceptance criteria, run automated tests and linters in CI, and require at least one approval prior to merging. Releases follow a documented checklist (pre-release checks, smoke tests, rollback plan, and release notes) with automated pipelines preferred for production deployment; rollback and incident playbooks are prepared for production failures. Execution-level tracking includes velocity and burndown metrics, dashboards for key signals, and a standing execution checklist covering branching conventions, CI configuration, demos, and regular risk register updates.

Personas and responsibilities are explicitly defined: Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; Developers implement, test, and document code; QA validates acceptance criteria and quality; and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. This clarity supports timely escalation (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and ensures risks and cross-team dependencies are elevated appropriately, with a distinct path for security incidents.

Communication is rhythmic and purposeful: daily 15-minute standups for immediate progress and blockers, a weekly delivery sync to surface progress and flagged risks, scheduled demos at milestone ends, and a weekly PM+PdM alignment plus monthly stakeholder updates. Quality assurance is layered—unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA when needed—while retrospectives after sprints and releases convert learnings into prioritized action items tracked in the backlog.
